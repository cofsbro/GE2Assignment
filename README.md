**GE-2 Assignment **

*My project:*

The aim of my project is to recreate/reimagine a space battle scene from Stargate and Stargate Atlantis. Originally was planing on using the battle over Antarctica, using swarm following and attacking other ships. Use free assets I could find and get working with unity, I plan on using various space battles as refrences to create a space battle.

My aim is to try and make a space battle having a space ship travel from a space stargate to another part of the galaxy to engage the enemy.

*Storyboard Idea*
Still with what assests can work for me my plan is to have a space ship move from one stargate to another, to another region of space avoiding enemies and asteroids. With the possibility shooting enemy ships. And as said previously maybe have a swarm attack go through the stargate to destroy the enemy ships.
